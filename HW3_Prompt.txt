1. (5 points) There are 2 different binary trees with 2 nodes if we don't care about the key values in them but only their shapes we get:

      o          o
     /    and    \
   o                o

    Use recursion to argue that there are 5 different binary trees with 3 nodes.
    How many different binary trees with 4 nodes are there ? Justify your answer.

2. (10 points) Write a C++ function that takes in an arithmetic expression in prefix notation and converts it into a binary tree, such that each operation is stored in a node whose left subtree stores the left operand, and whose right subtree stores the right operand.

3. (15 points) Complete the bag6 class implementation (i.e. complete the following functions in the bag6.template for 5 points each):

template <class Item>
typename bag<Item>::size_type bag<Item>::count(const Item& target) const
template <class Item>
void bag<Item>::insert(const Item& entry)
template <class Item>
typename bag<Item>::size_type bst_remove_all
